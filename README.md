The game was built using the **Unity** engine and a collection of **royalty-free** resources from the internet.

> [!NOTE]  
This videogame was developed during my time as a student, under a tight deadline and while managing other projects.
It offers the core functionality, but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code thatâ€™s not production-ready.
