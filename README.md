**ManriQuest** is a 2D medieval fantasy platformer where you collect coins,
dodge deadly traps, and battle your way to a challenging final boss.

The project was built using the **Unity** engine and a collection of
**royalty-free** resources from the internet.

> [!NOTE]  
This application was developed during my time as a student, under a tight
deadline and while managing other projects. It offers the core functionality,
but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code thatâ€™s not production-ready.
